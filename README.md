# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview of the Project
### To see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.
- Visualize Tectonic Plate Data
- Visualize Major Earthquake Data
- Visualize an Additional Map

## Results
### By adding map options and a legend, it gives the audience a dymanic image of Earthquakes in relation to major tectonic plates around the world.

### Here are two examples of how you can view the map in addition to the first one:

###### ![Street_View](https://github.com/raineytracyn/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/Earthquake_Challenge/Images/Street_View.png)
## Summary
### It is important to be able to lap different types of information on one another over a map to see how the information corrolates. 

## Drawback
### Map 1 and Map 3 are not ideal to view ths information in relation to the colors. It would be helpful to adjust colors of the information being presented to align with the colors of the map in the background.

## Recommendations
- Recommendation: To have a selection of colors to choose from so it appeals to a wide variety of audiences.
